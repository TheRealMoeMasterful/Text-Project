# List the things you added for points

For the additional points, I have done the following:
I have included more than 8 knots (total of 28 knots)
I have included mutliple items that can be picked up (water, flashlight, and feather), all of which change the outcome of certain actions or allow the player to take actions they wouldn't be able to otherwise. 
I have made it so that the description for each knot only displays the first time the player visits it using a cycle that ends with blank space. Certain elements of the description are excluded from this and are displayed always to highlight their importance in the scene. Each knot also has a [Look] action that the player can use to request the description again.
I did not include a stat system.
